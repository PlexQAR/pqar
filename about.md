## About PQAR

**Plex Quantum Atomic Research (PQAR)** is an ambitious research project focused on advancing knowledge and developing innovative technologies in nuclear science and related fields. 

### Our Projects

PQAR is currently developing the **HGCTR (Hybrid Gas Cooled Transmutation Reactor)**. This groundbreaking project represents a significant step forward in nuclear energy technology, addressing critical challenges in waste management and power generation.

**HGCTR Overview:**

The HGCTR is designed to:

* **Transmute spent nuclear fuel:** By converting long-lived radioactive isotopes into shorter-lived or stable elements, the HGCTR effectively recycles nuclear waste, minimizing its environmental impact and contributing to a more sustainable fuel cycle.
* **Generate clean energy:** The HGCTR utilizes a gas-cooled fast reactor design for efficient heat transfer and power generation, providing a reliable source of clean energy.
* **Optimize resource utilization:**  The HGCTR's ability to process spent fuel reduces the demand for fresh uranium mining, promoting responsible resource management.

**Key Features:**

* **Hybrid design:** Combining the benefits of fast reactors and transmutation technology.
* **Gas-cooled:** Utilizing helium as a coolant for enhanced safety and efficiency.
* **Advanced materials:** Employing specialized materials for optimal performance and neutron moderation.
* **Innovative core configuration:**  Strategic placement of fuel, coolant, and moderator for maximized efficiency and safety.

**OpenMC Simulation:**

The HGCTR design has been successfully implemented in OpenMC, a powerful Monte Carlo particle transport code. Extensive simulations are being conducted to assess its performance, safety, and operational characteristics.

**PQAR's Commitment:**

PQAR is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of nuclear technology through rigorous research and development. The HGCTR project exemplifies our commitment to creating sustainable and efficient energy solutions while addressing the challenges of nuclear waste.

**Other Projects:**

PQAR has stopped all other projects to focus and finish on one at a time.
