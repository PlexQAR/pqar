## What is IB-CLS?

IB-CLS, or Internal Busy-Core Linux System, is a custom Linux distribution developed by **Plex Quantum Atomic Research (PQAR)**. It is a specialized operating system based on **Tiny Core Linux**, designed to support a wide range of hardware, from small devices like the Raspberry Pi to industrial equipment.

### Key Features

- **BusyBox Integration**: At its core, IB-CLS utilizes BusyBox, a suite of Unix utilities combined into a single executable, optimized for minimal resource consumption. This makes IB-CLS lightweight and efficient, perfect for environments where resources are constrained.

- **Hardware Versatility**: IB-CLS is built to be flexible, supporting various hardware platforms. Whether you're working with a Raspberry Pi or managing complex industrial machinery, IB-CLS offers the necessary tools and compatibility.

- **Modularity**: Much like Tiny Core Linux, IB-CLS is modular. You can add or remove components as needed, allowing for a highly customizable and efficient system tailored to your specific use case.

- **PQAR's Research Focus**: While IB-CLS is versatile enough for general use, it is particularly suited for PQAR's research and development projects, where precision, reliability, and adaptability are crucial.

### Applications

IB-CLS is designed for internal use at PQAR but can be adapted for broader applications. Its primary focus is on supporting PQAR's research initiatives, including:

- Controlling and monitoring industrial equipment.
- Running experiments that require stable, lightweight, and customizable software environments.
- Supporting various hardware setups in experimental research, such as particle accelerators and nuclear reactors.

### Conclusion

IB-CLS represents a strategic investment in the development of specialized, adaptable Linux systems. By building on the robust foundation of Tiny Core Linux and BusyBox, IB-CLS ensures that PQAR can meet its diverse research and operational needs efficiently and effectively.

Stay tuned for more updates as PQAR continues to innovate and expand the capabilities of IB-CLS.
