# PQAR - Plex Quantum Atomic Research

**PQAR** (Plex Quantum Atomic Research) is a research project dedicated to advancing nuclear technology and energy solutions. The focus is on innovative nuclear systems, including reactor designs and particle accelerators, to address energy efficiency, waste management, and scientific research.

## PQAR Projects

### 1. **IB-CLS (Internal Busy-Core Linux System)**
   - A custom Linux operating system tailored for a wide range of hardware applications, from Raspberry Pi devices to industrial equipment. It is based on Tiny-Core Linux with BusyBox, designed for internal use within PQAR.

### 2. **MMTR-2380 (Modular Magnox Type Reactor 2380)**
   - A modular, small-scale Magnox reactor designed for research purposes. It utilizes pure U-238 natural uranium fuel within zirconium rods and is moderated by graphite. MMTR-2380 is focused on radiation testing and research.

### 3. **MRPA (Modular Research Particle Accelerator)**
   - A particle accelerator designed for modular research applications. MRPA is intended for advanced studies in particle physics and related fields, providing flexibility for various experimental setups.

### 4. **TPR (Transmutation Power Reactor)**
   - An innovative nuclear reactor designed for efficient energy generation and nuclear waste management. The TPR transmutates long-lived radioactive isotopes into shorter-lived or stable elements, reducing the environmental impact of nuclear waste while generating power.

## Vision and Mission

PQAR aims to push the boundaries of nuclear technology through cutting-edge research and development. The projects under PQAR focus on creating sustainable and efficient energy solutions while addressing the challenges of nuclear waste management and advancing our understanding of atomic science.
